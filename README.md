The `VSCode Reveal` plugin supports live-preview of the slides. Just click on the plugin on the left bar. Four toolbar buttons show up at the top. Click on `"Revealjs: Show presentation by side"` to instantly navigate through your presentation. Try out the other buttons for other preview modes and checkout the [docs](https://www.evilznet.com/vscode-reveal/#/README).
